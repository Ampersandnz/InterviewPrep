Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half. Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to the x-axis.

As a square is symmetrical, any line that passes through its centre will bisect it into identical halves.
Therefore, we need to find the line that passes through the centre of both squares.

Assumption: We have the co-ordinates and dimensions of both squares
Centre of each square = ((top right x - top left x)/2 + top left x, (top left y - bottom left y)/2 + top left y)
Line equation: y = mx + c
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the centres of the two squares
Sub x1 and y1 into the equation to calculate c
