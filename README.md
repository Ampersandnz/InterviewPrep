# InterviewPrep
Completing technical interview questions from the textbook "Cracking the Coding Interview".

The repository is structured into one main folder per topic, containing subfolders, each with a single Java or Python project that fulfils a single question from the book.

My goal is to complete at least one question per day where possible in order to prepare myself for similar questions that may be asked during coding interviews, as well as to keep my skills up to scratch even where my work is too specialised/simplistic.
