Tutorial: Learn You A Haskell [http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction]

All variables immutable
Functions have no side-effects - they take inputs, calculate something, and return a value
  Possible to write to files?
Static typing with Type Inference

People use ' and the end of a function name to denote strict or slightly modified version of the function

:l Func
  Loads in the functions from the source file Func.hs
    :r to reload with changes

Functions names may not begin with an upper-case letter

Else clause in conditionals is mandatory - Function MUST return a value

Strings are just lists of characters - list operations work on them

Haskell appears to use linked lists internally
  Appending to end (list ++ [x]) is slow for large n
  Inserting to first (x:list) is fase

Retrieving from list: list !! index

Lists can nest

List operators:
  head = first element (list !! 0)
  tail = ALL other elements (NOT just the last)
  last = last element (list !! length)
  init = ALL other elements (index 0 : length -1)
    None of these functions work on an empty list
  length = self-explanatory
  null = Returns a boolean emptiness check
  reverse = returns the reverse
  take = gets n elements from beginning of list

Infix functions:
  input `func` input2
    eg val `elem` list
  Do NOT need to be written differently - this notation will work on anything with two inputs

Ranges:
  [1..20]
  [a..g]
  Can specify a step
  [2,4..30]

  Lazy evaluation allows for infinite lists as inputs into other functions (NOT as variables)
    take 24 [13,26..]
