There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have
been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly
two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your
answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

It is impossible. A simple, intuitive proof is that each domino must cover a single white square and a single black square, but as each pair of opposite corners are the same colour, there are now 2 fewer squares of either white or black and it is impossible to cover every space.
