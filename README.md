# InterviewPrep
Completing technical interview questions from the textbook "Cracking the Coding Interview".

The repository is structured into one main folder per topic, containing subfolders, each with a single Java or Python project that fulfils a single question from the book. Currently I am storing the entire Eclipse/PyCharm project, but this should probably be altered to only keep source files on GitHub.

My goal is to complete the entire set of questions within the book (except for possibly some things like the language-specific chapters), and to store investigations into various areas of interest/use in a logical and structured manner.
