Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points.

Assumption: 'line' does in fact mean a linear formula of the form y = mx + c, and not a curve of any kind, as it would be possible to construct a curve which passed through every point, no matter how complex the arrangement.

Naive approach:
Each valid solution will pass through a minimum of two points.
Therefore, construct a dictionary of point - point pairs and iterate over them, counting the number of points intersected.
Keep track of the current maximum, and once it is found, use the standard (x2 - x1) / (y2 - y1) approach to calculate the gradient.
Then plug in any of the known points along the line to get the y-intercept.
This algorithm will find the correct answer (and, in fact, all equal highest answers), but it has a time complexity of O(n^2)
