There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100
lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles
every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed). This process
continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith
locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100,
how many lockers are open?

The lockers that are open are the ones which are products of an odd number of numbers between 1 and 100, including 1 and themselves.
Therefore, once the process is complete the lockers remaining open are perfect squares, as any other number will have an even number of factors:

1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
