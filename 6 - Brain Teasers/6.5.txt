There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it
will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given two
eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.

While I've seen this problem answered online and I know a better approach exists, I can't figure it out myself so I'd use a simple binary search.
Drop egg # 1 from the 50th floor, egg #2 from the 25th or 75th (depending on the result of the first drop), and continue halving the search space until an answer of sufficient accuracy is found.

The question itself is a little confusing - it seems to want to minimise egg usage while finding N, but also states that only two eggs are provided.
